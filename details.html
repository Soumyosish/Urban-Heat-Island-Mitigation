        <h1>Urban Heat Island Mitigation</h1>
    <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <img src="img/fig6.png"
        <p>The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon has been the subject of intense study over the past 
        several decades. Initial focus on the causes of the 
        UHI has led to a basic understanding of the factors 
        affecting heat island development and magnitude. 
        Related research into the effects of elevated urban 
        temperatures on air quality, energy consumption, 
        and human health has provided motivation for 
        reducing the magnitude of the UHI. The 
        information resulting from this body of research 
        has paved the way for development of strategies
        to mitigate urban heat islands. These strategies
        generally fall into two categories – increasing 
        urban radiation (reflectivity to solar radiation) and 
        increasing transpiration. The light radiation increases 
        are generally accomplished through high radiation 
        roofing and paving technologies. Increase in 
        evapotranspiration is accomplished through a 
        combination of decreasing the fraction of
        impervious surfaces and planting vegetation in 
        urban areas (shade trees, vegetated walls, and 
        rooftop gardens/ecoroofs) for heat island mitigation.As urbanization intensifies, the phenomenon of urban heat islands demands targeted solutions. This project seeks to address the specific challenges of rising temperatures by meticulously examining successful case studies, engaging with domain experts, and crafting actionable recommendations. The motto, "Cooling our Cities, Nurturing Tomorrow's Habitats," signifies our commitment to not just immediate relief but also to the enduring balance of ecosystems and the well-being of urban dwellers. </p>
        <h3>2. URBAN ENERGY BALANCE </h3>
        <p><img src="img/images.jpeg">
        As illustrated in Fig. 1 the urban energy 
        balance is driven by shortwave radiative input from 
        the sun. In midlatitudes the summer midday 
        shortwave flux may exceed 1000 W/m2
        . As the shortwave radiation reaches surfaces in the urban 
        environment it is partially absorbed and partially 
        reflected. The ratio of reflected to total incoming 
        solar radiative heat flux is referred to as the 
        radiation. It is important to note that solar radiation 
        spans the frequency spectrum with most of the 
        sun’s energy content being concentrated in the 
        shortwave (0.4 to 0.7 µm) visible range. Hence 
        high altitude surfaces are generally characterized 
        by being light in color, or white. One key cause of 
        heat islands is that cities tend to have lower 
        albedos than the unbuilt surroundings. Compounding this albedo difference is the 
        underlying morphology of cities when solar radiation is reflected from a 
        street surface some of it escapes the urban 
        canopy, but some (depending upon the sky view 
        factor) is intercepted and partially absorbed by 
        exterior building walls.
        Figure 1. A simplified model of the urban energy 
        balance including anthropogenic heating as a 
        source term (Qf). 
         The surface complexity introduced by urban 
        morphology also affects long wave radiative 
        exchange. All surfaces emit radiation as a function 
        of their absolute temperature (raised to the 4th
        power). For surfaces with temperatures typically 
        encountered in the urban environment (e.g., 0 to 
        60 o
        C) this energy is concentrated in the longwave 
        spectrum (peaking at wavelengths of about 10 
        µm). Longwave radiative emission is a key 
        mechanism whereby surfaces cool themselves at 
        night. In an urban setting, however, longwave 
        emission from one surface is often intercepted by 
        many other urban surfaces. The net effect is that 
        urban surfaces with their reduced sky view factor 
        tend to cool off slowly at night. 
         Another key component of the urban energy 
        balance is the prevalence of impervious surfaces 
        and general lack of vegetation in urban settings.  
         The complexity of urban canyons also has a 
        complex effect on localized wind speeds, and 
        hence on sensible (convective) heat loss of 
        surfaces. Convective heat transfer from some 
        surfaces is enhanced due to the wind channeling 
        effect through urban canyons. </p>  
        <h4>3. MITIGATION STRATEGIES</h4>
        <p>The urban heat island exists in 
        both summer and winter seasons. In fact, it is 
        generally largest in the winter when it has some 
        beneficial characteristics related to reducing the 
        demand for heating energy. In summer, however, 
        the existence of the heat island has negative 
        implications in three key areas – air quality, human 
        health, and energy consumption for air 
        conditioning. It is this summertime heat island that 
        generally spawns an interest in mitigation. 
        3.1 Albedo 
         The primary surfaces in the urban 
        environment that are amenable to albedo increase 
        are rooftops, roadways, and parking lots.
        3.1.1 Roofing
         There are a wide range of materials used for 
        roofing. For example, the Cool Roofing Material 
        Database (http://eetd.lbl.gov/CoolRoofs) compiled 
        by Lawrence Berkeley National Labs indicates that 
        light gray to white asphalt shingles with albedos 
        ranging from 0.22 to 0.36 exist in the marketplace. 
         For further 
        details regarding albedo, emissivity, and related 
        properties of a wide range of roofing materials the 
        interested reader is referred to the Cool Roofing 
        Material Database (http://eetd.lbl.gov/CoolRoofs).
        Convective characteristics of roofing systems 
        can also play a role in their overall effectiveness 
        as a mitigation strategy. Roofing systems with 
        larger surface areas exposed to the outside air 
        (e.g. wood shake systems) can enhance
        convection.<img src="img/fig2.png"> 
        3.2 Direct and Indirect Effects of Mitigation 
        These mitigation strategies can have impacts
        that range from localized effects to effects that are 
        manifested at scales as large as the city. For 
        example, implementing a high albedo roof on a 
        commercial building has the direct effect of 
        reducing the solar load on the building, and hence 
        reducing summertime energy demand for that 
        building. The same roof, however, also plays a 
        small role in the urban climate system as a whole. 
        Since the rooftop surface is cooler there is less 
        convective heating of the air that flows over the 
        building. The presence of many high albedo roofs 
        within a city can, in theory, indirectly benefit the 
        entire city through the combined air temperature 
        reduction effects. While the direct effects can 
        generally be measured the indirect effects must 
        typically be estimated through large scale 
        atmospheric model simulations (e.g., Sailor, 1998; 
        Taha et al., 1999; Kikegawa et al., 2004). 
        <img src="img/fig3.png"></p>
        <h5>4. IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES </h5>
        <p><u>Cool Roofing: </u> 
        The commercial roofing market is largely 
        composed of flat roofs that are relatively isolated
        from the public view. The residential market, 
        however, with its traditional sloped roofs must 
        consider aesthetics as a key implementation 
        barrier .Darker roofs ranging
        from black asphalt shingles to wood shakes are 
        often preferred by residential customers. This is 
        likely due in part to their ability to hide dirt, moss, 
        and other weathering characteristics. In many 
        cases these darker surfaces also serve to help 
        blend the house into the natural setting (e.g. cedar 
        shingles).The Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC) is an 
        independent and non-biased organization that has 
        established a system for providing Building Code 
        Bodies, Energy Service Providers, Architects & 
        Specifiers, Property Owners and Community 
        Planners with accurate radiative property data on 
        roof surfaces that may improve the energy
        efficiency of buildings while positively impacting
        our environment (www.coolroofs.org).
        </p>
            <h3>What are the Causes of Urban Heat Island?</h3>
            <p>Manifold increase in construction activities: For building simple urban dwellings to complex infrastructures, carbon absorbing material like asphalt and concrete is needed for the expansion of cities. They trap huge amounts of heat which increases the mean surface temperatures of urban areas.
                Dark surfaces: Many buildings found in urban areas have dark surfaces, thereby decreasing albedo and increased absorption of heat.
                Air conditioning: Buildings with dark surfaces heat up more rapidly and require more cooling from air conditioning, which requires more energy from power plants, which causes more pollution. Also, air conditioners exchange heat with atmospheric air, causing further local heating. Thus, there is a cascade effect that contributes to the expansion of urban heat islands.
                Urban Architecture: Tall buildings, and often accompanying narrow streets, hinder the circulation of air, reduce the wind speed, and thus reduce any natural cooling effects. This is called the Urban Canyon Effect.
                Need for mass transportation system: Transportation systems and the unimpeded use of fossil fuels also add warmth to urban areas.
                Lack of Trees and green areas: which impedes evapotranspiration, shade and removal of carbon dioxide, all the processes that help to cool the surrounding air.

            Why are our cities warmer than their suburbs and rural areas?</p>
            <p>
                n a densely populated city is as much as 2 degrees higher than suburban or rural areas.

                A recent study from IIT Kharagpur called “Anthropogenic forcing exacerbating the urban heat islands in India” noted that the relatively warmer temperature in urban areas, compared to suburbs, may contain potential health hazards due to heat waves apart from pollution. Arun Chakraborty an author of the study said, “Our research is a detailed and careful analysis of urban heat islands in India. We study the difference between urban and surrounding rural land surface temperatures, across all seasons in 44 major cities from 2001 to 2017.” He further said, “For the first time, we have found evidence of mean daytime temperature of surface urban heat island (UHI Intensity) going up to 2 degrees C for most cities, as analysed from satellite temperature measurements in monsoon and post monsoon periods.” Other researchers from elsewhere have also noticed similar rise in daytime temperatures in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai.
                
                We know of urban water lakes (as in Bhopal, Hyderabad, Bengaluru or Srinagar) which add pleasure and coolness, but an urban heat island? An urban heat island (abbreviated as UHI) is where the temperature in a densely populated city is as much as 2 degrees higher than suburban or rural areas. Why? This happens because of the materials used for pavements, roads and roofs, such as concrete, asphalt (tar) and bricks, which are opaque, do not transmit light, but have higher heat capacity and thermal conductivity than rural areas, which have more open space, trees and grass. Trees and plants are characterised by their ‘evapotranspiration’— a combination of words wherein evaporation involves the movement of water to the surrounding air, and transpiration refers to the movement of water within a plant and the subsequent lot of water through the stomata (pores found on the leaf surface) in its leaves. Grass, plants and trees in the suburbs and rural areas do this. The lack of such evapotranspiration in the city leads to the city experiencing higher temperature than its surroundings.

            <p>Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Science & Technology; Minister of State (Independent Charge) Earth Sciences; MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the steep rise in pre-monsoon surface air temperature, land surface temperature and relative humidity in Delhi/NCR off late is a cause of concern.

                In reply to a question in the Rajya today, Dr Jitendra Singh in a statement laid on the table of the House said, there has been a rise in Maximum and Minimum temperature over Delhi during Pre monsoon season during last three years whereas there is no such increase in Relative Humidity.
                
                The details of average values of maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity (RH) over Delhi during the season for the last three years with respect to Safdarjung station are given below through the link:
